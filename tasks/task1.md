# Task 1 - WSC Date view

We already have HTML and CSS ready in `index.html` and `style.css` but now we want to create it as a component.

## TODO

 * In `components/wsc-date.js` you will find empy component which is already included in page

 * Date component should accept any string from wich we can parse a `Date`


## Bonus

Component can also accept unixTimestamp


## Hints:

### How to parse a Date in JS?

```js
new Date(string)
new Date(unixTimestamp)
```


### What can be parsed as Date?

```js
// Try this in browser console
const date = new Date()
date.toDateString()
date.toGMTString()
date.toISOString()
date.toJSON()
date.getTime()
```


## Formatting
```js

```
